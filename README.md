# FeuRouge Intelligent Connecté

## Description
The **FeuRouge Intelligent Connecté** is an IoT-based traffic light system designed to optimize traffic flow and enhance road safety. Leveraging the ESP8266 microcontroller, this smart traffic light system is capable of:
- Real-time traffic monitoring.
- Dynamic light adjustments based on traffic density.
- Remote control and monitoring through a web or mobile interface.

This project combines the power of IoT, embedded systems, and automation to create an efficient and modern traffic management solution.

## Features
- **Dynamic Traffic Control:** Adjusts signal timings based on traffic density detected by sensors.
- **Connectivity:** Uses ESP8266 for Wi-Fi connectivity to enable remote monitoring and control.
- **User Interface:** Web-based interface for real-time status updates and manual control.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Optimized power usage for efficient and sustainable operation.

## Components
### Hardware
1. ESP8266 (NodeMCU or similar module)
2. Traffic light LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
3. Ultrasonic sensors or IR sensors for traffic detection
4. Resistors and connecting wires
5. Power supply

### Software
1. Arduino IDE
2. ESP8266 Wi-Fi library
3. Web server library (e.g., ESPAsyncWebServer or similar)
4. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the web interface

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Install the Arduino IDE.
- Install the ESP8266 board support package in the Arduino IDE.
- Install the required libraries: 
  - `ESPAsyncWebServer`
  - `ESP8266WiFi`
  - `Ultrasonic` (or equivalent for the sensor used).

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feurouge-intelligent-connecte.git
    ```
2. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Configure your Wi-Fi credentials in the code:
    ```cpp
    const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
    const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";
    ```
4. Connect the ESP8266 to your computer and upload the code.
5. Assemble the circuit as per the schematic in the repository.
6. Access the web interface by entering the ESP8266's IP address in your browser.

## Usage
- The system will automatically adjust traffic light timings based on sensor readings.
- Open the web interface to:
  - View the current status of the traffic lights.
  - Manually control the traffic lights (if needed).
- The system will log traffic data for analysis.
